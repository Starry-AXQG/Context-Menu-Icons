***—————————— Method Two： install manually（not recommend) ————————————***
（Manual installation requires you to frequently manually replace the files in order to support future updates.)

1. 📁 **Create the Chrome Folder**
   If you haven't already, follow the [Zen Live Editing Guide](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing) to create your `chrome` folder.

2. 📦 **Download the Mod(Choose any one of the following download methods.)**
   - Download the files from the repository (click "Code",then click"Download ZIP")
   - Download the file from the [latest release](https://github.com/1247343406/context-menu-icons-for-Zen/releases).
   - Extract it and paste the `icons` folder inside your `chrome` directory.

4. 🧩 **Apply the Mod**
   You have two options:

   **Option A** – *Manual Import*
   - Open your `userChrome.css` and add:
     ```css
     @import "icons/icons.css";
     ```
  no have userChrome.css?
  
  **Option B-1**
   - open (or create) `userContent.css` and add:
     ```css
     @import "icons/icons.css";
     ```
   **Option B-2** – *Use Provided Files*
   - Use the `userChrome.css`  files provided in the ZIP and paste them directly into your `chrome` folder.

5. 🔄 **Restart the Browser**
   Reopen Zen to apply the UI changes.

[Here you can view all the preference settings of CMI.](https://github.com/1247343406/context-menu-icons-for-Zen?tab=readme-ov-file#-preferences-)

*** ⚠️If you are using the Firefox browser and choose to install manually⚠️  ***

you must ensure that in `about:config`, the setting of `svg.context-properties.content.enabled` is set to `true`. This preference is a necessary condition for the mod to function properly. The mod has incorporated the detection of this preference. If you do not do this, the mod will directly refuse to execute.If you use Sine, all these tasks will be completed automatically.

If all of the above are confirmed to be correct, after restarting the browser, you should be able to see the changes.
